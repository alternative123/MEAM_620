MEAM 620 Project 1 Phase 3
Trajectory Generation and Control of a Quadrotor
Author: Qiong Wang
Date: 02/6/2013


In this project, I have accomplished the following tasks:
1. The implementation of trajectory generation for the quadrotor from given path generated by Dijkstra.
2. The combination of phase 1 and phase 2.

Folders:
phase1							3D Path Planning
phase2							Control of Quadrotor

Functions:
init_script.m					Initialize the reduced path with trajectory_generation.
trajectory_generation.m			Merge and reduce path from Dijkstra and generate a trajectory.

Additional Function:
ndlinspace.m					Referring from 2009, Jos van der Geest. It can do the linspace in 
								n-dimension and is used to interpolate.

Thanks
